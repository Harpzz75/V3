    <p class="small">I have always been interested in art and design, from early school days to the present. Fortunately I have been able to gain some qualifications and work in the industry for many years. More recently with the rapid advances in technology, especially web technology, I have swung to a more digital <br>design way of thinking and working and have been involved in many fantastic<br>projects including web banners/ads/animations, email template design and builds, UI/UX design, Social Media<br>ads/graphics/campaigns etc and lots of other exiting web graphics and projects.</p>
    <p class="small">o with having a good understanding of overall graphic design processes and techniques I find myself wanting to know and learn more about “The Dark Side”, as it is sometimes referred to by Graphic Designers, meaning the back end functioning of web<br>pages/apps/banners/ads and the like. Having worked closely with developers for many years I have a developed<br>a fascination and keenest to explore this more.</p>
    <p class="small">I love keeping up with the ever changing world which this is, I find it both challenging and thrilling as there is always something new to learn and discover. Not a day goes by when you don’t find a new solution to a question or you learn something new. And the possibilities are become increasingly more<br>endless as the technology grows and improves.</p>
    <p class="small">So this why I joined Code Nation, to try and realise my ambitions and put them into practice. My experience so far has been awesome, I have really enjoyed all of it, the course so far has included many different practices from organisational skills, team management, time management, logical thinking, a bit of<br>maths/equations/formulas etc and above all giving us an idea as to what the whole industry sector is all about.</p>
