        <p class="small">Obviously more time available to spend on the project would have helped, but it could also be seen as a test to experience working to a deadline, which is a massive factor in the industry. Maybe better use of organisational sowtware such as Trello and Slack, using them to to their full advantage. I personally have never used either but I'm sure as I get familir with them continue to help me organise and streamlin my projects. Working in teams could also have some benefits, if contrsructed and thought about carefully. A team could consist of say a developer, a copywriter, a designer and a project manager, each carrying different parts of their project individually then bringing each others work together through the process. We have done this web project individually in a virtual learning environment due to the current lockdown. Whist this is fully embracing technology to continue working, would it have been better to be working in a classroom sat next to other students? Maybe it would in some ways. But I suppose we have to say that we have used the technology available to us to suit the situation we are in.</p>
